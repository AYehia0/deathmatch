# Deathmatch

A classic terminal survival game with zero combat and no mercy.  
You are trapped in a sealed arena, hunted by robots.  
Your only weapon is movement—lure robots into each other, shape the arena with debris and shrubs, and survive as long as possible.  
There is no escape, no final level, and no winning—only a score to beat.
